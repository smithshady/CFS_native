## 3.0 Customization and Extension

#### Storage Service

The storage service is provided at __run-time__ by the application.  The storage service may be managed outside of the library and can contain its own application interfaces for
configuring and statusing.

#### Operating System Abstraction

The operating system abstraction is provided at __compile-time__ and must supply all the functions exported by "bplib_os.h".

Inside "bplib_os.h" there are two #defines that constrain the size of the numbers that the library supports:
* BP_VAL_TYPE - the C type used to represent the largest integer value that can be used by the library.
* BP_INDEX_TYPE - the C type used to represent an index into the active table.

## 4.0 Coding Rules

#### Include Rules

1. An application may only include headers from the `inc/` directory.

2. All library modules may include "bplib.h" and "bundle_types.h".

3. The only inclusion of "bplib_os.h" occurs in "bplib.h"; library modules must include "bplib.h" to pull in "bplib_os.h".

4. A library module may only include headers from `common/` modules or from the modules in the layer directly below it in the architecture diagram.

5. No functions or data may be extern'ed in a header file (except in unit tests).  All functions and data types should be pushed to the smallest scope of exposure as possible (i.e. functions only called within a module should be static, typedefs and defines only used within a module's source file should be defined in the source file instead of the header).

#### Status Rules

1. All API functions return a return code as defined in the "bplib.h" list of return codes; and other value must be passed back through pointers.

2. Return codes are for use by application code, flags are for use by humans.  An application should never need to look at the status flags.

3. Status flags are cumulative and should never be cleared in a library function, nor should they ever be used by a library function - they should only be set.  The application is responsible for when the flags are cleared.
