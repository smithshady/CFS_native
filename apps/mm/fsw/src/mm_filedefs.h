 * \brief MM Load and Dump file header structure
 * We use the same header structure for both dump and load files so a dump
 * file can be reloaded back into memory if desired (providing a memory save
 * and restore capability). This MM header is the secondary header, the
 * standard cFE file header is primary header for all load and dump files.
