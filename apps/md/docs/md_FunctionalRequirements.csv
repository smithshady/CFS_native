a) Table ID
b) <OPTIONAL> Signature
c) Number of bytes sampled
d) Data","Send a message containing all of the data after all of the data is collected.

message is the sum of all of the delays contained in the corresponding dwell
table times the wake-up rate."

a) If a symbolic address is specified, Symbol Table is present and symbolic address is contained in the Symbol Table,
b) resolved address (numerical value of symbolic address if present + offset address) is within valid range
c) if resolved address is specified for a 2-byte dwell, address is an even value,
d) if resolved address is specified for a 4-byte dwell, address is an integral multiple of 4.",Protects against operator error.
MD3002.4,MD3002.4,<OPTIONAL>  Symbol Name and offset can be used in lieu of an absolute address,"If symbolic addressing supported, symbolic names and offset can be used instead of an absolute address"
