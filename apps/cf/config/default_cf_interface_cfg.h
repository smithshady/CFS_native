 *       The outgoing file data chunk size is also limited from the table configuration
 *       or by set parameter command, which is checked against this value
 *       (+ smallest possible PDU header).
 *
 *  @par Note:
 *       This does NOT limit Rx PDUs, since the file data is written from
 *       the transport packet to the file.
 *
 *  @par Limits:
 *       Since PDUs are wrapped in CCSDS packets, need to respect any
 *       CCSDS packet size limits on the system.

/**

 *      Additional padding bytes to be appended to the tail of CFDP PDUs
 *      This reserves extra space to the software bus encapsulation buffer for every
 *      CFDP PDU such that platform-specific trailer information may be added.  This
 *      includes, but is not limited to a separate CRC or error control field in addition
 *      to the error control field(s) within the the nominal CFDP protocol.
 *
 *      These extra bytes are added at the software bus encapsulation layer, they are not
 *      part of the CFDP PDU itself.
 *
 *      Set to 0 to disable this feature, such that the software bus buffer
 *      encapsulates only the CFDP PDU and no extra bytes are added.
 *
 * @par Limits:
 *       Maximum value is the difference between the maximum size of a CFDP PDU and the
 *       maximum size of an SB message.
