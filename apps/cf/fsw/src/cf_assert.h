/**
 * \name CF assert macro
 *
 * CF_Assert statements within the code are primarily informational for developers,
 * as the conditions within them should always be true.  Barring any unforeseen
 * bugs in the code, they should never get triggered.  However, if the code is
 * modified, these conditions could happen, so it is still worthwhile to keep
 * these statements in the source code, so they can be enabled if necessary.
 *
 * The debug build assert translates CF_Assert to the system assert.
 * Note that asserts may still get disabled
 * if building with NDEBUG flag set, even if CF_DEBUG_BUILD flag is enabled.
 *
 * It should be impossible to get any conditions which are asserted, so it should
 * be safe to turn these off via the normal build assert.  This is the configuration
 * that the code should be normally tested and verified in.
