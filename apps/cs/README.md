# core Flight System (cFS) Checksum Application (CS) 

## Introduction

The Checksum application (CS) is a core Flight System (cFS) application that 
is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the cFS.  
  
The CS application is used for for ensuring the integrity of onboard memory.  
CS calculates Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs) on the different memory regions 
and compares the CRC values with a baseline value calculated at system startup. 
CS has the ability to ensure the integrity of cFE applications, cFE tables, the 
cFE core, the onboard operating system (OS), onboard EEPROM, as well as, any 
memory regions ("Memory") specified by the users.

The CS application is written in C and depends on the cFS Operating System 
Abstraction Layer (OSAL) and cFE components. There is additional CS application 
specific configuration information contained in the application user's guide.

User's guide information can be generated using Doxygen (from top mission directory):

## Software Required

cFS Framework (cFE, OSAL, PSP)

An integrated bundle including the cFE, OSAL, and PSP can
be obtained at https://github.com/nasa/cfs
 
## About cFS

The cFS is a platform and project independent reusable software framework and
set of reusable applications developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data
systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems.  More
information on the cFS can be found at http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov
